## Introduction

_Hello, Here Luis from Team T.W.L., and again I and my colleagues will expand a little in the operational elements present in the robotic solution for this 2023 season._

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  

  

_The designed robotic solution model this time consists of a robot car, being built from scratch with some 3d printed elements, and powered by an ESP-32 once again, but this time with the addition of an expansion module, in wich we will expand later on._

_Anyways, the robot car possesses the following main elements:_

  

  

   -   _Motors: The robot has four direct current (DC) motors that allow it to move in different directions. The motors are connected to an L298N motor controller that regulates the speed and direction of rotation of each motor. In addition, the robot has two servomotors that allow it to rotate the ultrasonic plate and the camera._  



   
  -   _ESP-32: Dual-Core SoC Chip (System on a Chip) of low cost and energy that uses a Tensilica Xtensa LX6 microprocessor (both in the one used here, and in its single or dual-core variants). This being the principal element on the entire robot (because, well, it is the one thing that powers the robot and makes possible all of its functions).

 


   -   _Expansion Module:  _ 

  

 
   -   _Ultrasonic board: The robot has an HC-SR04 ultrasonic board that works as a sonar. The “Head” moves, emiting sound waves and measuring the time they take to bounce off nearby objects. In this way, the robot can measure the distance to obstacles and avoid them. The ultrasonic board is mounted on a servomotor that allows it to rotate and explore the environment._  
  

  

   -   _Camera: The robot has an OV2640 camera that can be connected to the ESP32. The camera has a resolution of 2 megapixels and can capture images in color or grayscale. The camera is used to recognize objects, people or colors using artificial vision algorithms. The camera is also mounted on a servomotor that allows it to orient itself._  

  
  

   -   _Custom Chasis: Since this design is made almost from nothing, we had to recreate some (if not all) of the pieces, being made both from cardboard and other easy-to-find materials, and 3d printed, being only the chasis and other small parts that had to be very resistent 3d printed. _

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

_The artificial vision algorithms that are used to recognize objects or colors are computer programs that process the images captured by the OV2640 camera and extract relevant information from them. For example, to recognize colors, We use an algorithm that converts color images to grayscale and then applies a red, green or blue color mask depending on the color we want to detect. Then, we calculate the percentage of pixels of the desired color in the image and compare it with a predefined threshold to determine whether or not there is presence of the color. The way to load the code would be to connect a Micro-USB cable to the USB port of the ESP32, start loading the code from the programming environment and wait for the process to finish._

  
_The objective of this robotic solution model is to demonstrate the capabilities of the ESP32 chip and its possible applications in the field of educational robotics. The robot can perform different tasks such as following a line, avoiding obstacles, recognizing colors or expressing emotions._

_Thank You._
